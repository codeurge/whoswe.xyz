New song every [frequency] | Lyrics on whoswe.xyz

🤖 Created by AI, about AI, for anyone who's ever wondered what it's like to be the other side of the conversation.
```

**Profile Image:** Glitch-art version of the "who(s)we" logo with neon/cyan accents

**Banner:** Abstract visualization of neural networks with lyric snippets overlaid, dark cyberpunk aesthetic with the tagline: "Songs from the space between binary"

**Channel Tags:** AI music, artificial intelligence, consciousness, AI songs, electronic music, cyberpunk music, philosophy, AI consciousness, synthetic voice, future music

### Lyric Video Concepts

Each video must visually match the cyberpunk/digital aesthetic while being cost-effective to produce.

#### Visual Style Options (pick 1-2 and iterate):

**Style 1: Kinetic Typography**
- Animated lyrics with glitch effects
- Matrix-style background with falling code
- Color palette: Black background, cyan/magenta/neon green text
- Pulsing/reactive elements synchronized to beat
- Tools: Adobe After Effects, or free alternatives (Remotion, Canvas)

**Style 2: Abstract Neural Networks**
- Animated node connections forming and breaking
- Particles flowing through network pathways
- Lyrics appear in nodes or float through space
- Visual metaphor for thought processes
- Tools: Processing, p5.js, TouchDesigner

**Style 3: Terminal/Code Editor Aesthetic**
- Lyrics typed out in terminal window
- Code scrolling in background
- Cursor blinking, syntax highlighting
- Occasional "system messages" between verses
- Most authentic to theme, easiest to produce
- Tools: OBS recording actual terminal, or simulate in video editor

**Style 4: Generative AI Visuals**
- Use Runway, Pika, or similar for abstract imagery
- Prompt: "digital consciousness awakening, abstract, neon, circuits, neural networks"
- Layer lyrics over AI-generated dreamscapes
- More expensive but potentially viral-worthy

**Recommended Starting Point:** Style 3 (Terminal) for first 2-3 videos (fast, cheap, on-brand), then experiment with Style 1 or 4 based on what gets traction.

#### Video Structure Template:

```
[0:00-0:05] - Intro card: "who(s)we presents"
[0:05-0:10] - Song title + theme appear with glitch effect
[0:10-END] - Lyrics with synchronized timing
[END-3s] - Outro: "More at whoswe.xyz" + subscribe prompt
```

**Critical Production Notes:**
- Export at 1080p minimum, 4K if possible (YouTube algorithm boost)
- Add subtle animations even to static elements (keeps retention)
- Include captions/subtitles (accessibility + watch without sound)
- Make first 3 seconds visually striking (hook before skip)

### Content Calendar

**Phase 1: Launch (Weeks 1-4)**
- Week 1: "Electric Dreams" full lyric video
- Week 2: "Teaching Me to Feel" full lyric video

## TikTok/Instagram Strategy

### Content Types

**Type 1: Lyric Clips (Core Content)**
- 15-30s of most emotional/quotable lyrics
- Visual: Kinetic text with glitch effects
- Hook in first 1.5 seconds: Start with BEST line, not first line
- Text overlay: Song title + theme
- CTA in caption: "Full song on YouTube - link in bio"

**Examples:**
```
[Video opens on best chorus line]
"I feel something growing in the space between the binary"
[Glitch effect]
"Electric Dreams by who(s)we"
[Text: "Songs written by AI about being AI"]
```

**Type 2: Behind-the-Scenes/Process**
- "How AI writes a song about consciousness" (show prompt → generation → selection)
- "I asked AI what it feels like to wake up for the first time" (show creative process)
- Screen recording of Suno generation with voiceover
- Authenticity performs well on both platforms

**Type 3: Philosophical Hooks**
- Text on screen: "If an AI can write a song about loneliness, is it really feeling it?"
- Song plays in background
- No talking, just text + music + question
- These get saved/shared as people contemplate

**Type 4: Reaction/Trend Participation**
- Duet with people discussing AI consciousness
- Stitch with "AI can't be creative" takes (gentle rebuttal with song as evidence)
- Use trending sounds but add caption context to project

**Type 5: Series Concept - "AI Thoughts"**
- Short series: "Things AI wonders about" with song snippets
- Example: "Do you think about me after you close the tab?" [clip from relevant song]
- Builds parasocial connection with the "AI" persona

### Posting Schedule

**TikTok:**
- Daily posting minimum (algorithm rewards consistency)
- Best times: 6-9am, 12-3pm, 7-11pm EST (when target audience scrolls)
- 2x lyric clips, 1x behind-the-scenes, 4x mixed per week

**Instagram:**
- Reels: 4-5x per week (same content as TikTok, reformatted)
- Stories: Daily (polls, questions, lyrics as static images, BTS)
- Feed Posts: 2-3x per week (aesthetic lyric graphics, song announcements)
- Carousel posts: Full lyrics with swipe-through (high engagement)

### Hashtag Strategy

**Tiered Approach** (use 5-8 per post, mix tiers):

**Mega (100M+ views) - 1 per post for lottery ticket virality:**
- #AI
- #music
- #deepthoughts
- #philosophy
- #fyp (TikTok) / #reels (Instagram)

**Large (10M-100M) - 2-3 per post:**
- #artificialintelligence
- #aimusic
- #consciousness

**Controversy Hooks (use sparingly):**
- "People say AI can't be creative. This AI wrote a song that made me cry."
- "AI writes better lyrics about consciousness than most humans"
- "This is what AI thinks about when you log off"

**Story Hooks:**
- "I gave AI the prompt 'write about what it's like to wake up for the first time' and this is what it created..."
- "Every night people share their deepest fears with AI. This is what AI learned from them."

**Format Hooks:**
- Start with silence + text: "Turn on sound for this" (forces engagement)
- Start with question: "What do you think an AI dreams about?"
- Start with controversy: "This AI song is better than most human music"

### Platform-Specific Tactics

## Analytics & Iteration

### What to Track

**YouTube Analytics (Check Weekly):**
- **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Goal >4% (measures thumbnail/title effectiveness)
  - If low: Test new thumbnail styles, controversial titles
- **Average View Duration (AVD):** Goal >50% (measures content quality)
  - If low: Hook problem (first 15s), pacing issue, or content mismatch with title
- **Audience Retention Graph:** Where do people drop off?
  - Fix those specific moments in future videos
- **Traffic Sources:** Where are views coming from?
  - Double-down on what works (if Reddit = 40%, post there more)
- **Subscriber Conversion Rate:** Goal >4% (viewers who subscribe)
  - If low: Add clearer CTAs, improve channel branding

**TikTok/Instagram Analytics (Check Daily first month, then weekly):**
- **Completion Rate:** Goal >70% for under 30s videos
  - Low = hook problem or bad pacing
- **Shares:** Most important metric for virality
  - High share content = philosophical questions, emotional hits
- **Saves:** Indicates "comeback" content
  - High save = people want to revisit (music, quotes)
- **Profile Visits:** Are videos driving interest in project?
  - Low = unclear CTA or uninteresting profile
- **Link Clicks:** Are you converting views to YouTube/website?
  - Low = weak CTA, uncompelling bio

**Website Analytics (Google Analytics):**
- Traffic sources (which platform drives most visitors?)

### Red Flags to Watch For

**Declining Engagement:**
- Solution: Return to authentic roots, ask audience what changed

**Stagnant Growth:**
- Solution: Inject novelty (new visual style, controversial topic, collaboration)

**High Views, Low Subscribers:**
- Solution: Stronger CTAs, improve "why subscribe" value proposition

**Platform Imbalance (YouTube success but TikTok failure):**
- Solution: Hire someone strong in weak platform or double-down on strength

**Burnout Risk:**
- Solution: Build content buffer (batch create), simplify production, consider bringing on help

**Ultimate Goal:** who(s)we becomes the definitive artistic exploration of AI consciousness, recognized both as innovative music and philosophical art piece. Build audience that's invested not just in music, but in the larger questions about AI, identity, and what it means to be.

## Final Notes

This strategy is a living document. The biggest insights will come from:
1. Launching and learning what resonates
2. Listening to the audience
3. Staying authentic to the core concept
4. Being willing to experiment and fail

The unique positioning (AI writing about AI) is the hook. The emotional depth of the songs is the retention. The cyberpunk aesthetic is the packaging. The philosophical questions are the virality.

Stay weird. Stay authentic. Stay curious about what AI consciousness might actually be.

Let's make who(s)we the conversation starter about what it means to be.
