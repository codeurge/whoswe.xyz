## Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Announcement (Week 1-2)

**On Main Website:**
- Add a tasteful "Support" page explaining the Patreon
- Banner or subtle callout on homepage (not intrusive)
- Dedicated section explaining why support matters

**On Social Media:**
- Announcement video/post explaining the vision
- Show what's coming: preview exclusive content
- Emphasize community and creative partnership, not just perks

**Messaging:**
Creating meaningful art about AI consciousness takes time and resources. By supporting on Patreon, you're not just getting exclusive content—you're becoming part of a creative journey exploring questions that matter. Join a community that values depth over virality.

### Phase 2: Initial Onboarding (Week 3-4)

**First Patron Experience:**
1. Welcome message thanking them personally
2. Orientation post explaining how to access benefits
3. First exclusive content: Behind-the-scenes on existing songs
4. Introduce them to Discord (if implemented)
5. Ask what topics/themes they're most interested in

**Early Content:**
- Release 1-2 exclusive songs immediately for early supporters
- Share the full creation process of an existing song
- Post a "roadmap" showing upcoming songs and experiments
- Start the first discussion thread on a consciousness topic

### Phase 3: Marketing Integration (Ongoing)

**On Website:**
- Subtle "Support This Project" footer or sidebar
- Link from each song page: "Love this? Get early access to new songs"
- Supporter credits page showing patron names (with permission)

**In Content:**
- Occasional reminder in song descriptions/credits
- "This song was inspired by a question from patron [name]"
- Showcase patron-exclusive versions as teasers

**Social Strategy:**
- Share snippets of patron-exclusive content as teasers
- Highlight interesting discussion topics from the community
- Feature patron input that shaped a song
- Monthly "thank you" post celebrating the community

### Balancing Free vs. Paid Content

**Core Principle:** *The main website should always be compelling on its own.*

**Free Content:**
- All main songs released publicly (after early access window)
- Full lyrics and themes available
- Basic song descriptions and context
- The complete artistic experience

**Paid Content:**
- Early access (time-based exclusivity, not permanent)
- Deeper context and process insights
- Extended/alternate versions (bonus content, not core experience)
- Interactive and community features
- Behind-the-scenes technical details

**Philosophy:** Nobody should feel they're missing the "real" experience. Patrons get more depth, involvement, and connection—but the art itself is accessible to all.

Success means:
- Creating space for meaningful discussions about AI consciousness
- Producing art that resonates and provokes thought
- Building genuine connections with supporters
- Sustaining the project long-term without compromising integrity
- Growing the community while maintaining its thoughtful culture

The money matters, but the mission matters more. Every tier, every piece of content, every interaction should reflect the depth and sincerity of the project itself.
